title: "Session 3: Guide to Using Prompt Engineering Effectively with Java Web"
description: >-
  Prompt engineering is essential when integrating AI-driven solutions into Java Web applications. When using large language models (LLMs) like OpenAIâ€™s models, a well-structured prompt can significantly improve the accuracy and relevance of AI-generated responses.

## 1. Best Practices for Using Prompts in Java Web

### 1.1. Understand the Use Case

Before writing a prompt, clearly define the objective. Here are different use cases and example prompts:

#### 1.1.1. AI-Generated Content (Automated Responses)
- **Use Case**: You want AI to generate predefined content dynamically, such as automated email replies or FAQ answers.  
- **Example Prompt**:

```prompt
You are an AI assistant helping Java Web developers. Generate a clear and concise response to the following FAQ question:
Question: "What is the difference between a Servlet and a JSP?"
Response format: A short technical explanation (50-100 words).
```

#### 1.1.2. AI for Form Validation or Recommendations
- **Use Case**: You want AI to check if user input (e.g., a password) follows certain security rules or recommend improvements.  
- **Example Prompt**:  

```prompt
Validate the following user password according to these rules:
- At least 8 characters long
- Contains a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- No common dictionary words
Password: "User123"
Return output in JSON format:
{
"isValid": true/false,
"message": "Validation message"
}
```

#### 1.1.3. AI as a Chatbot for User Queries
- **Use Case**: You want AI to answer user queries dynamically in a chatbot.  
- **Example Prompt**:  

```prompt
You are an AI chatbot helping Java Web developers. Answer the following question in a friendly and professional manner:

Question: "How can I connect a Java Servlet to a MySQL database?"

Response format: 
- A short introduction
- Code example (if applicable)
- Explanation in simple terms
```

### 1.2. Structure Your Prompt Properly

To get accurate and relevant responses, use these techniques:

#### 1.2.1. Be Clear and Concise
- Instead of *"Tell me about Servlets"* (vague)  
- Use *"Explain what a Java Servlet is and how it works in a web application"* (specific)  

**Example Prompt**: 

```prompt
Explain in simple terms what a Java Servlet is and how it processes HTTP requests. Keep the response under 100 words.
```

#### 1.2.2. Specify the Format of the Expected Output
If you need JSON output for an API response, specify it explicitly.  

**Example Prompt**:  

```prompt
Provide a JSON-formatted response for a user profile in a Java web application. Fields include:
- "username" (string)
- "email" (string)
- "role" (admin/user)
- "lastLogin" (date in YYYY-MM-DD format)
Example JSON output:
{
  "username": "john_doe",
  "email": "john@example.com",
  "role": "admin",
  "lastLogin": "2025-03-12"
}
```

#### 1.2.3. Provide Examples for Better Understanding
If you expect code output, show an example.  

**Example Prompt**:  

```prompt
Generate a Java Servlet that handles user login. The servlet should:
- Accept username and password via POST request.
- Validate credentials against a hardcoded list.
- Redirect to "dashboard.jsp" if valid, else show an error.
Example:
Servlet: LoginServlet.java
```

#### 1.2.4. Use Delimiters to Distinguish Instructions from Input

If your prompt includes user input, use delimiters like ### or <<< >>> to separate instructions.

**Example Prompt**:  

```prompt
### INSTRUCTIONS ###
You are an AI assistant for Java web developers. Answer the user's query in a technical and structured manner.
### USER QUERY ###
What is a JavaBean, and how is it used in JSP?
Temperature and max tokens control response style and length.
```

#### 1.2.5. Lower Temperature (0.2) for Factual, Consistent Responses

Use low temperature when you need reliable and structured responses.

**Example Prompt**:  

```prompt
You are an AI tutor for Java web development. Provide a step-by-step guide on how to configure a JDBC connection in a Servlet.
Use structured, factual information.
Temperature: 0.2 (accurate, consistent)
Max Tokens: 200 (concise response)
```

#### 1.2.6. Higher Temperature (0.8-1.0) for Creative Outputs

Use high temperature when you need creative or varied responses.

**Example Prompt**:  

```prompt
Generate a fun and engaging error message for a failed login attempt in a Java Web application. Make it humorous but still professional.
Temperature: 0.9 (more creative, less predictable)
Max Tokens: 50 (short response)
```

#### 1.2.7. Limit max_tokens to Control Response Length

If you need a short summary, set a low max token value.

**Example Prompt**:  

```
Summarize the advantages of using JSP over Servlets in 50 words or less.
```

## 3. Using Prompt for Generative AI (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot): Create Static Website with FruitShopWebApp

```prompt
Create a modern, responsive Fruit Shop static website using **HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript**.  

Requirements:
- A visually appealing header (jumbotron) with a navbar for easy navigation.  
- Display a list of fruit products directly in the HTML with images, names, prices, and an "Add to Cart" button.  
- Ensure the images are uniform in height for a clean look.  
- Use CSS Flexbox or Grid for layout to maintain responsiveness.  
- Add a well-structured footer with copyright information and useful links.  
- The design should be user-friendly, mobile-optimized, and accessible.
```
