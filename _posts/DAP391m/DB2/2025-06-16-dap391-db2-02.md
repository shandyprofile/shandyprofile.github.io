# Installing and Creating the Service on IBM Db2

In this episode, we'll explore **multiple ways** to install and run IBM Db2, and guide you through creating your first database service.

---

## 1. Overview of Installation Options

IBM Db2 can be deployed in several environments depending on your use case:

| Option | Description | Best For |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Docker Container** | Fast and portable local setup | Developers, testing |
| **Native Installation** | Install directly on Linux/Windows OS | On-premise dev/prod |
| **Db2 on Cloud** | Fully managed by IBM Cloud | Production, no-maintenance setup |
| **Db2 Warehouse** | Cloud or local analytics warehouse | BI/Analytics workloads |
| **Developer-C Edition** | Free edition with limited resources | Learning, sandbox testing |
| **Db2u on Kubernetes** | Containerized Db2 for OpenShift/K8s | Cloud-native, enterprise |
| **Cloud Pak for Data** | AI/ML platform with Db2 built-in | Full data & AI pipelines |

---

## 2. Quick Setup: 
### Option A - Docker (Recommended for Local Development)

```bash
docker pull ibmcom/db2

docker run -itd --name db2 \
  -e DB2INST1_PASSWORD=Passw0rd \
  -e LICENSE=accept \
  -p 50000:50000 \
  -v db2data:/database \
  ibmcom/db2
```

Then access:

```bash
docker exec -it db2 bash
su - db2inst1
db2start
```

### Option B - Native Installation (Linux Example)

```bash
wget https://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/data/db2/community/db2server_base_11.5.8_amd64.deb

sudo apt install ./db2server_base_11.5.8_amd64.deb

# Create Db2 instance and start
sudo /opt/ibm/db2/V11.5/instance/db2icrt -a server -u db2fenc1 db2inst1
su - db2inst1
db2start
```

### Option C - IBM Db2 on Cloud
- No installation needed.
- Fully managed by IBM.
- Create at: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/db2-on-cloud

After provisioning:
- Get credentials from the dashboard
- Connect via CLI, JDBC, or REST API
- Highly available (HA), backup, monitoring included

### Option D - Db2 Developer-C Edition (Free)

- Download: https://www.ibm.com/products/db2/developer-edition
- Supports Linux, Windows, Docker
- Limited to:
  - 16GB RAM
  - 4 CPUs
  - 100 concurrent connections

Still includes full feature set for development/testing.

### Option E - Db2u on Kubernetes (Advanced)
- Containerized version for OpenShift / Kubernetes
- Suitable for DevOps pipelines
- Install using Helm or OperatorHub
- Documentation: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/11.5?topic=db2u

## 3. Create Your First Database (All Options)
After installation, inside your Db2 environment:

```bash
db2start                      # Start Db2 engine
db2 create database mydb      # Create database
db2 connect to mydb           # Connect to DB
db2 "SELECT current date FROM sysibm.sysdummy1"
```
- Replace `mydb` with your desired database name.
