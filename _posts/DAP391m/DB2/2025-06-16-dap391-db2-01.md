## Introduction to IBM Db2

**IBM Db2** is a high-performance **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)** developed by IBM. It is designed to manage large volumes of structured data efficiently, offering robust support for enterprise environments, analytics, and AI integration.

---

## 1. What is IBM Db2?

IBM Db2 is a database system that:

- Supports **relational data models** with SQL standards.
- Runs on multiple platforms:
  - Linux
  - UNIX (AIX, Solaris, HP-UX)
  - Windows
  - IBM z/OS (Mainframe)
- Offers solutions for:
  - OLTP (Online Transaction Processing)
  - OLAP (Online Analytical Processing)
  - Data warehousing
  - Cloud-based or on-premise deployment
- Has been evolving since the 1980s, now available in both traditional and cloud-native forms (Db2 on Cloud, Db2 Warehouse, Db2u for containers).
