## 1. Choose a tool for coding

You can use a number of tools to support website development such as Atom, Notepad++, Sublime Text, Adobe Dreamweaver CC, Visual Studio Code, CoffeeCup HTML Editor, Netbeans,...

Particularly for the LAB lessons in this course, I will use Visual Studio Code.

You can download Visual Studio Code via this link:
https://code.visualstudio.com/download

After that, you proceed to install Visual Studio Code tools normally like other applications

## 2. Create a static web project

If you want to create a static web project, you can follow like this:

In the local computer, you can organize the folder structure on your computer as follows:

+ Folder css: It contains .css files for styling your web page.
+ Folder images: It contains image files which is used for your site. Moreover, you can create some folders such as video, audio,...and it is the same level with “images” folder.
+ Folder js: It contains Javascript files (.js files) for interaction with your site.
+ You can create many .html files in the same level with folders above. Or you can put .html files to other folders (depending on the intended use).

## Academic policy

- Cheating, plagiarism and breach of copyright are serious offenses under this Policy.
- Cheating Cheating during a test or exam is construed as talking, peeking at another student’s paper or any other clandestine method of transmitting information.
- Plagiarism Plagiarism is using the work of others without citing it; that is, holding the work of others out as your own work.
Breach of Copyright If you photocopy a textbook without the copyright holder's permission, you violate copyright law.

## Prerequisite(s)
PRF192 - Programming Fundamentals

## Java Technology

Java technology is a high-level, robust, and secure programming platform. It includes:

- **Java Programming Language**: A powerful, object-oriented language.
- **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**: Executes Java bytecode and enables cross-platform functionality.
- **Java Application Programming Interface (API)**: A large collection of ready-to-use libraries and tools.

## The Java Programming Language

Java is:

- **Object-Oriented**: Based on objects and classes.
- **Platform-Independent**: Write once, run anywhere (WORA) through the JVM.
- **Strongly Typed**: Type checking at both compile-time and runtime.
- **Syntax Similar to C/C++**: Makes it easy for developers from those backgrounds.

## Java Platform

The Java platform includes:

- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Tools for developing Java applications.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Libraries and JVM needed to run Java applications.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: Core of the platform that runs bytecode.

### Java Platform Editions

- **Java SE (Standard Edition)**: Core functionality for general-purpose programming.
- **Java EE (Enterprise Edition)**: Tools for enterprise-level applications (now Jakarta EE).
- **Java ME (Micro Edition)**: Tailored for embedded systems and mobile devices.
- **JavaFX**: For developing rich GUI applications.

## Bytecode

- **What is Bytecode?**: Intermediate, platform-independent code generated by the Java compiler.
- **Executed by the JVM**, not directly by the operating system.
- Enables **portability**, **security**, and **performance optimization**.
- Stored in `.class` files after compiling `.java` source files.

## Example: A Simple Java Program

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
