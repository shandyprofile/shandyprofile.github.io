## Overview
This project guides students through building an E-commerce Backend System using a Microservices Architecture. Each service is developed independently with its own responsibilities, database, and codebase. The project introduces essential backend development practices such as authentication, inter-service communication, event-driven design, containerization, and API Gateway patterns.

By the end of the project, students will have hands-on experience in building, running, and deploying scalable microservices using modern tools and NodeJS-based frameworks.

| ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1**  | **Introduction to Microservices & Architecture**<br>Monolith vs Microservices, service boundaries          | Microservice Architecture, Service Decomposition | System architecture diagram, service definitions        |
| **2**  | **Build the User Service (ExpressJS)**<br>Registration, login, hashing, JWT generation, MongoDB connection | ExpressJS, Mongoose, JWT, bcrypt                 | Functional `user-service` with authentication API       |
| **3**  | **Build the Product Service (ExpressJS)**<br>CRUD products, input validation, clean folder structure       | ExpressJS, MongoDB, Joi                          | `product-service` with independent CRUD API             |
| **4**  | **Build the Order Service (ExpressJS)**<br>Save order documents, use product & user IDs internally         | ExpressJS, MongoDB                               | `order-service` with basic order creation functionality |
| **5**  | **Notification Service using HonoJS**<br>Minimalistic logging or alert service                             | HonoJS, REST API                                 | `notification-service` for async logs/notifications     |
| **6**  | **Event-Driven Architecture with RabbitMQ**<br>Publish/Subscribe model, message queue communication        | RabbitMQ, amqplib                                | Services publish and consume events asynchronously      |
| **7**  | **JWT Authentication Across Services**<br>Token verification, middleware, role-based access control        | JWT, Express Middleware                          | All protected routes verify JWT correctly               |
