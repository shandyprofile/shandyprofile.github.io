title: 'Epoch 6: Event-Driven Architecture with RabbitMQ'
description: >-
  In this epoch, students will introduce asynchronous communication into the system using RabbitMQ. Instead of making direct HTTP requests to the Notification Service, the Order Service will publish events (e.g., "order_created") to a message queue, which the Notification Service will then consume and log. This architecture helps decouple services, improve scalability, and ensures fault tolerance between microservices.

##  Objectives
- Understand the Pub/Sub (Publishâ€“Subscribe) model.
- Install and run RabbitMQ using Docker.
- Use amqplib to connect to RabbitMQ in Node.js.
- Publish messages from order-service.
- Consume messages in notification-service.

## 1. What is RabbitMQ?
RabbitMQ is a message broker that enables services to send messages to each other via queues, allowing asynchronous, decoupled communication.
> Instead of one service calling another directly, it publishes a message to a queue â€” and other services subscribe to that queue and act upon it.

## 2. Set Up RabbitMQ with Docker
Add this service to your main docker-compose.yml (youâ€™ll complete this in Epoch 9 â€” for now, run it separately):
- rabbitmq-docker.yml
```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  rabbitmq:
    image: rabbitmq:3-management
    ports:
      - "5672:5672"       # AMQP protocol
      - "15672:15672"     # Management UI
```

Start RabbitMQ:
```bash
docker compose -f rabbitmq-docker.yml up -d
```

- Check the UI at: http://localhost:15672
- Login: guest / guest
## 3. Publish Events from Order Service

### Step 1: Install amqplib
In the order-service:

```bash
npm install amqplib
```
### Step 2: Create rabbitmq.js utility
In utils/rabbitmq.js:
```js
import amqplib from 'amqplib';

let channel;

export async function connectRabbitMQ() {
  const connection = await amqplib.connect('amqp://localhost');
  channel = await connection.createChannel();
  await channel.assertQueue('order_created');
}

export function publishOrderCreated(order) {
  channel.sendToQueue('order_created', Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(order)));
}
```
### Step 3: Modify order creation to publish event
In controller after order.save()
```js
import { publishOrderCreated } from '../utils/rabbitmq.js';

await publishOrderCreated({
  orderId: order._id,
  userId: order.userId,
  totalItems: order.items.length,
  createdAt: order.createdAt,
});
```
> Call connectRabbitMQ() when server starts.

## 4. Consume Events in Notification Service
### Step 1: Install amqplib

```bash
npm install amqplib
```

### Step 2: Create consumer logic
In src/consumer.js
```js
import amqplib from 'amqplib';

async function consumeNotifications() {
  const conn = await amqplib.connect('amqp://localhost');
  const channel = await conn.createChannel();
  await channel.assertQueue('order_created');

  channel.consume('order_created', (msg) => {
    const content = JSON.parse(msg.content.toString());
    console.log('ðŸ”” Received Order Event:', content);
    channel.ack(msg);
  });
}

consumeNotifications();
```

Run this file along with the notification server:
```bash
node src/consumer.js
```
