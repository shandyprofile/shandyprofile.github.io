Embedded below is essentially the simplest Express app you can create. It is a single file app — ***not*** what you’d get if you use the [Express generator](./2025-09-15-express-generator-03-express-application-generator), which creates the scaffolding for a full app with numerous JavaScript files, Jade templates, and sub-directories for various purposes.

```js
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const port = 3000

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
})

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${port}`)
})
```

This app starts a server and listens on port 3000 for connections. The app responds with “Hello World!” for requests to the root URL (/) or route. For every other path, it will respond with a **404 Not Found**.

**Running Locally**

First create a directory named `myapp`, change to it and run `npm init`. Then, install `express` as a dependency, as per the [installation guide](./2025-09-15-express-generator-03-express-application-generator).

In the `myapp` directory, create a file named `app.js` and copy the code from the example above.

>The req (request) and res (response) are the exact same objects that Node provides, so you can invoke req.pipe(), req.on('data', callback), and anything else you would do without Express involved.

Run the app with the following command:

$ node app.js
Then, load **http://localhost:3000/** in a browser to see the output.
