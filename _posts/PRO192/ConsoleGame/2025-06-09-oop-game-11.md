## 1. Built the project
A console-based MOBA-style Java game using full OOP design.

| Feature           | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Heroes         | Base class + subclasses (Warrior, Mage) using inheritance                  |
| Encapsulation  | Properties like hp, name, skills are private with controlled access         |
| Abstraction    | Hero, Skill, and StatusEffect are abstract base classes                     |
| Polymorphism   | Override methods like useSkill() and apply()                                |
| Design Patterns| Factory Pattern (ChampionFactory) for champion creation                     |
| Battle System  | Turn-based loop: Player vs Bot                                               |
| Status Effects | Burn, Stun, and Heal effects via StatusEffect                               |
| PvE Bot        | Basic AI using random decisions   

## 2. Architecture Overview

├── BurnEffect.java / HealEffect.java / StunEffect.java

├── Main.java
```

## 3. Expansion Ideas

Here are ways students can extend the game and keep learning:

### 1. Cooldowns for Skills
Add cooldown to Skill class and prevent usage until ready.

```java
protected int cooldown;
protected int currentCooldown;
```

### 2. Smarter Bot AI
Make bot evaluate HP, choose heal, or stun tactically.

### 3. Save/Load System
Use file I/O to let users save and resume games.

### 4. Add Buff/Debuff Effects
E.g., ShieldEffect, PoisonEffect, SpeedBoost, etc.

### 5. Multiple Champions (Team Fight)
Let players choose teams of 3 champions, battle in turns.

# Congratulations!
You've completed a full OOP Java game project using real-world design techniques. This foundation prepares students to:
- Understand game architecture
- Apply OOP in projects
- Start building GUI-based or online multiplayer games in the future!
