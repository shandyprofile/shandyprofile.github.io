## Overview
You will build a turn-based console game in Java, inspired by League of Legends (LoL). The game allows the player to:
- Select a champion from a list
- Fight against a bot opponent
- Use skills with special effects (stun, burn, heal)

This project demonstrates all 4 principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism

It also integrates:
- Factory Design Pattern
- Java Collections (List<Hero>)
- A game loop with PvE (Player vs Bot)

##  Learning Roadmap â€“ 10 Episodes

| Episode | Topic                              | Learning Objectives                                                                                                        |
| ------- | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Game structure setup               | Create the base folder and file structure. Write the Main class and display a welcome screen.                              |
| 2       |  Implement subclasses (Inheritance)  | Create specific hero types like Warrior, Mage, etc., inheriting from Hero.                                           |
| 3       | Define Hero class (Abstraction)  | Learn how to use abstract classes and interfaces to define common hero behavior.                                                 |
| 4       | Add Skills and Effects             | Build a Skill class and apply it to heroes. Use simple logic to deal damage.                                               |
| 5       | Use Collections (`List<Hero>`)     | Store available champions in a list and allow player to select one.                                                        |
| 6       | ChampionFactory (Factory Pattern)  | Implement a factory class to instantiate heroes by name dynamically.                                                       |
| 7       | Status Effects (Stun, Burn, Heal)  | Create a `StatusEffect` interface and apply real-time effects to heroes.                                                   |
| 8       | Basic Combat System                | Implement a turn-based combat loop between player and bot.                                                                 |
| 9       | Add a Bot AI                       | Create a `BotHero` class with basic decision-making to simulate PvE.                                                       |
| 10      | Polish and Extend                  | Improve game experience, refactor code, add more heroes, skills, and effects. Prepare for deployment or further expansion. |


## Key Concepts Practiced
- Object-Oriented Design
- Abstraction & Encapsulation
- Inheritance & Polymorphism
- Design Patterns (Factory)
- Java Collections (List, Random)
- Game logic: turns, skills, effects, AI
